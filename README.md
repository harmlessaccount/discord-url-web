# Discord URL CLI Web

This is a simple web interface to help contributors who are unfamiliar with JSON add new endpoints and important URL information about Discord on the [discord-url](https://github.com/harmlessaccount/discord-url) and the [discord-docs](https://github.com/harmlessaccount/discord-docs) projects.

# Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harmlessaccount/discord-url-web.git
cd discord-url-web
start index.html
```

This will open and execute the file in your default web browser. Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Pages version at https://harmlessaccount.github.io/discord-url-web/.
